## Description

This project focuses on networking basics and covers topics such as the OSI model, different types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, TCP and UDP protocols, and more. The project includes a series of tasks designed to test and reinforce knowledge in these areas.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the OSI model and its layers
- Understand LAN and WAN networks, their typical usage, and geographical sizes
- Define MAC and IP addresses and their roles in networking
- Differentiate between TCP and UDP protocols and their use cases
- Identify commonly used TCP/UDP ports
- Use tools like netstat and ping to check network connectivity

## Project Tasks

The project consists of the following tasks:

1. Task 0: OSI model
2. Task 1: Types of network
3. Task 2: MAC and IP address
4. Task 3: UDP and TCP
5. Task 4: TCP and UDP ports
6. Task 5: Is the host on the network?

Each task has specific requirements and questions that need to be addressed.
