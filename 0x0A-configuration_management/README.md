## Background Context

During my time at SlideShare, I had the opportunity to work on an auto-remediation tool called Skynet. Skynet was designed to monitor, scale, and fix cloud infrastructure. It leveraged a parallel job-execution system called MCollective, which allowed me to execute commands on one or multiple servers simultaneously. I could apply actions to specific sets of servers by using filters such as the server's hostname or other metadata like server type and environment.

However, a critical bug surfaced in my code. This bug resulted in sending a 'nil' value to the filter method, leading to two significant issues:

1. MCollective interpreted 'nil' as a command to apply actions to all servers.
2. The action I unintentionally sent was to terminate the selected servers.

The consequences were severe - 75% of SlideShare's conversion infrastructure servers were inadvertently shut down, causing widespread disruptions for users trying to convert their documents and media files.

Thanks to Puppet, we were able to recover our infrastructure in less than an hour. The incident underscored the importance of automation in managing complex infrastructure and avoiding potential disasters.
