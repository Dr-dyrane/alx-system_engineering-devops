# Regular Expressions Project

This project is part of the ALX Software engineering program exercise. It focuses on exploring regular expressions (regex) using the Oniguruma library, which is the default regex library in Ruby. It includes various tasks that involve creating Ruby scripts to match specific patterns using regular expressions.

## Installation

To use the Regular Expressions Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Dr-dyrane/alx-system_engineering-devops.git`
2. Move into the project directory: `cd alx-system_engineering-devops/0x06-regular_expressions`

## Usage

Each task in the project is a separate Ruby script. To run a specific task, use the following command:

```
ruby <file-name>.rb <argument>
```

Replace `<file-name>` with the name of the Ruby script for the task you want to run, and `<argument>` with the appropriate argument required by the task.

## Resources

Before starting the project, it is recommended to review the following resources:

- [Regular expressions - basics](https://regexone.com/)
- [Regular expressions - advanced](https://www.regular-expressions.info/)
- [Rubular](https://rubular.com/) (a helpful tool for testing regular expressions)
- [Use a regular expression against a problem: now you have 2 problems](https://blog.codinghorror.com/regex-use-vs-regex-abuse/)
- [Learn Regular Expressions with simple, interactive exercises](https://regexcrossword.com/)

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line
- All Bash script files must be executable
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`
- All regular expressions must be built for the Oniguruma library

## Tasks

The Regular Expressions Project includes the following tasks:

- [Task 0: Simply matching School](./0x06-regular_expressions/0-simply_match_school.rb)
- [Task 1: Repetition Token #0](./0x06-regular_expressions/1-repetition_token_0.rb)
- [Task 2: Repetition Token #1](./0x06-regular_expressions/2-repetition_token_1.rb)
- [Task 3: Repetition Token #2](./0x06-regular_expressions/3-repetition_token_2.rb)
- [Task 4: Repetition Token #3](./0x06-regular_expressions/4-repetition_token_3.rb)
- [Task 5: Not quite HBTN yet](./0x06-regular_expressions/5-beginning_and_end.rb)
- [Task 6: Call me maybe](./0x06-regular_expressions/6-phone_number.rb)
- [Task 7: OMG WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?](./0x06-regular_expressions/7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb)
- [Task 8: Textme (Advanced)](./0x06-regular_expressions/100-textme.rb)

Each task has its own Ruby script file that you can run individually.
