## Introduction

This project focuses on setting up an application server and deploying a web application. The primary goal is to configure an application server environment using Gunicorn, Nginx, and Flask to serve a web application. In addition to the basic setup, this project also covers advanced topics such as updating the application without service interruption and creating a systemd script for process management.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- An Ubuntu 16.04 LTS server or a compatible environment.
- Python3 installed on your server.
- Knowledge of working with Linux command-line interfaces.
- Familiarity with Gunicorn, Nginx, Flask, and web application deployment.

## Project Overview

The project consists of several tasks, each building upon the previous one. Here's a high-level overview of the tasks involved:

- **Task 0: Set up Development with Python**
  - This task involves setting up a development environment for testing and debugging your web application before deploying it to production.
  - You'll clone your AirBnB clone project, install necessary packages, and configure your Flask application.

- **Task 1: Set up Production with Gunicorn**
  - In this task, you'll configure the production application server using Gunicorn. This is crucial for serving dynamic content and ensuring a consistent environment between development and production.
  - You'll install Gunicorn and libraries required by your application, and configure Gunicorn to serve content from a specific route and port.

- **Task 2: Serve a Page with Nginx**
  - This task focuses on configuring Nginx to serve your web page both locally and on its public IP.
  - Nginx will proxy requests to the Gunicorn instance, creating a robust and efficient web server setup.

- **Task 3: Add a Route with Query Parameters**
  - Building on the previous tasks, you'll expand your web application by adding a service for Gunicorn to handle.
  - You'll configure Nginx to proxy HTTP requests to a specific route with query parameters to a Gunicorn instance listening on a different port.

- **Task 4: Deploy it! (Advanced)**
  - In this advanced task, you'll create a systemd script to manage your Gunicorn application server. This script ensures that your application server starts automatically on server boot, reducing manual intervention.

- **Task 5: No Service Interruption (Advanced)**
  - Another advanced task, this one involves gracefully reloading Gunicorn without service interruption. This technique is crucial to ensure high uptime and minimal disruptions when updating your application.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Set up Development with Python

In this task, you'll set up a development environment for your web application. Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Clone the project repository to your server.
2. Install the necessary `net-tools` package.
3. Clone your AirBnB clone project on your web server.
4. Configure the Flask application to serve content from a specific route and port.

Example:
```shell
Window 1:
$ python3 -m web_flask.0-hello_route
...
Window 2:
$ curl 127.0.0.1:5000/airbnb-onepage/
Hello HBNB!
```

### Task 1: Set up Production with Gunicorn

For this task, you'll configure the production environment using Gunicorn. Follow these steps:

1. Install Gunicorn and any required libraries.
2. Configure the Flask application to serve content using Gunicorn.

Example:
```shell
Terminal 1:
$ gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 web_flask.0-hello_route:app
...
Terminal 2:
$ curl 127.0.0.1:5000/airbnb-onepage/
Hello HBNB!
```

### Task 2: Serve a Page with Nginx

In this task, you'll configure Nginx to serve your web page through a specific route. Follow these steps:

1. Configure Nginx to serve the page both locally and on its public IP.
2. Proxy requests to the Gunicorn instance.

Example:
```shell
On my server:
Window 1:
$

 gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 web_flask.0-hello_route:app
...
On my local terminal:
$ curl -sI 35.231.193.217/airbnb-onepage/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
```

### Task 3: Add a Route with Query Parameters

To expand your web application, follow these steps to configure Nginx to proxy requests with query parameters:

1. Configure Nginx to proxy requests to multiple Gunicorn instances.
2. Handle routes with query parameters.

## Usage

Here's how you can interact with our Application Server project:

1. **Testing Your Application Locally**: To test your application on your local machine, you can use a tool like `curl` to make HTTP requests to your server. For example:

   ```bash
   $ curl -sI http://localhost:5000/airbnb-onepage/
   ```

2. **Using Your Web Application**: If you have a web application running on your server, you can access it through a web browser or using command-line tools like `curl`.

3. **API Access**: If your project includes APIs, provide detailed documentation on how to make API requests, including the endpoints, request methods, and expected responses.
