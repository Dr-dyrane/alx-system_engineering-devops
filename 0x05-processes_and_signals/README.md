## Introduction

Processes and signals are fundamental concepts in operating systems and software development. Understanding how processes work and how signals can be used to communicate with them is crucial for building robust and efficient systems.

This project offers practical examples and explanations of processes and signals to enhance your knowledge and skills in these areas. It covers various topics, including process creation, process termination, signal handling, and interprocess communication.

## Repository

The project repository can be found at: [https://github.com/Dr-dyrane/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x05-processes_and_signals](https://github.com/Dr-dyrane/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x05-processes_and_signals)

The repository contains the following files and directories:

- `0-what-is-my-pid`: Bash script to display the PID (process ID) of the current script.
- `1-list_your_processes`: Bash script to display a list of currently running processes.
- `2-show_your_bash_pid`: Bash script to display the PID and process name of the Bash script itself.
- `3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy`: Bash script to display the PID and process name of the Bash script itself, using a simpler command.
- `4-to_infinity_and_beyond`: Bash script that runs an infinite loop.
- `5-kill_me_now`: Bash script that kills a specified process.
- `6-kill_me_now_made_easy`: Bash script that kills a specified process, using a simpler command.
- `7-highlander`: Bash script that displays "To infinity and beyond" indefinitely, until receiving a specific signal.
- `8-beheaded_process`: Bash script that kills the process with a specific name.
- `100-process_and_pid_file`: Bash script that creates a file containing the PID of a specified process.
- `101-manage_my_process`: Bash script that manages a process, including starting, stopping, and displaying its status.
- `102-zombie.c`: C program that creates 5 zombie processes. For every zombie process created, it displays Zombie process created, PID: ZOMBIE_PID.

Feel free to explore the repository and dive into each script to understand the concepts and techniques employed.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Dr-dyrane/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `0x05-processes_and_signals` directory:

   ```
   cd alx-system_engineering-devops/0x05-processes_and_signals
   ```

Now you are ready to explore the scripts and experiment with processes and signals.

## Usage

Each script in the repository serves a specific purpose and can be executed individually. To run a script, use the following command:

```
./<script_name>
```

For example, to run the `0-what-is-my-pid` script, execute:

```
./0-what-is-my-pid
```

Refer to the comments within each script for more details about what it does and how to use it.
